Below are a list of mods I''m considering adding to the game.  

Secret Rooms (http://www.minecraftmods.com/secret-rooms-mod/) 
Animals + (http://www.minecraftmods.com/animals/) - mainly because it would add variety
Gany's Surface (http://www.minecraftmods.com/ganys-surface/) For hidden trap doors, and colored redstone
Botania (http://www.minecraftmods.com/botania/) Not sure about this, but would make our story more diverse when building things
Redstone Paste (http://www.minecraftmods.com/redstone-paste/) This could be in place of Gany's Surface.  Allows for smarter/easier redstone working
Butterfly Mania (http://www.minecraftmods.com/butterfly-mania/) Because butterflies
Minecraft Comes Alive (http://www.minecraftmods.com/minecraft-comes-alive/) Adds RPG type things to the game, if configurable, this could be awesome
Chat Bubbles (http://www.minecraftmods.com/chat-bubbles/) Really great if we can use it for NPCs...
Custom NPCs (http://www.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/221826-custom-npcs) needs testing, but we can hopefully use this to put in NPCs
Security Craft (http://www.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/securitycraft-mod#t1:screenshots) may make it easy for us to do security checks
Mob Talker (http://www.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/mobtalker2) would probably replace Custom NPcs, but seems more awesome
RPG Advanced Mod (http://www.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/220611-rpg-advanced-mod) allows for smart waypoints
Lost Books (http://www.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/lost-books) will make our quest items much easier?
radio (http://www.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/dragons-radio-mod) possibly for pre-recorded audio

FTP Infinitiy - use their map writer instead of what we have
Possibly Optifine instead of fastcraft (test)
