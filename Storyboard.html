			<h2>PREQUEL</h2>
			The year 2012, the tech boom is beginning again, world population is spiraling out of control, and climate change threatens many of the 
			best lands for farming.  A group of wealthy donors, in conjunction with a major pharmaceutical company gather a group of the 
			brightest scientists and send them to a remote island to do their research in peace (and secrecy).  Their goal is to create a 
			superfood that can feed the masses, as well as create an energy source that is more efficient than nuclear without the 
			potential for catastrophic failure.  
			
			Overall, the two teams made up 80 of the world's top scientists, each lead by a team leader.  In charge of creating a superfood
			was the scientist Dr. Llewyn Matasan.  In charge of energy was Dr. Daiyu Zhāng.
			
			The two teams slowly terraformed the remote island, creating a town, docs, and different research labs.  The abundant resources 
			of the island, coupled with some rare and exotic flaura, have lead to some interesting breakthroughs in their research.  
			
			Things were going great until mid 2014 when the parent company was caught engineering and manufacturing bioweapons for terrorist
			groups.  The government quickly shut the company down and sold off it's assets.  The remote island operation would have been 
			stopped as well, but there was no official record of it, so it remained open.  
			
			Having plenty of food and access to resources, the crews kept on their work, although with a more free spirit, now having no one 
			to answer to.  
			
			***
			One day, Dr. Matasan discovered that one of his experiments caused regeneration in cells.  He offered some of the elixir to 
			his pet and watched as his pet quickly healed it's wounds.  The pet also seemed to require less and less food.   "My goal 
			wasn't exactly to feed the world's population, but to keep the world's population alive...  If they eat less...  And regenerate
			then that can solve my problem."
			
			Quickly his line of thinking slipped from keeping the world's population alive to keeping himself alive - eternally.

		THE START OF THE GAME - CHAPTER 1
			<ul>
				<li>Explore the camp</li>
				<li>Introduction to the story</li>
				<li>Basic Gear-up</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Dr. Matasan introduction</h3>
			<p>It is revealed that Dr. Matasan was once working to create cheap/efficient food, but has turned to odd experiments which have led him to turn the local inhabitants of the 
				island into zombies, and soon many of his scientists.  </p>
			<p>Players will encounter the original research facility where Dr. Matasan was looking to grow crops.  It will provide them a wonderful source of basic food as well as 
				some super foods that will give them good buffs if they need.  In this will also be some side-quest diary entries as well as a main-quest entry where Dr. Matasan will talk about a
				new facility that is in the works to conduct more research.</p>
			<p>The players will not have access to the facility, but by walking up to the entrance they will trigger an item being dropped off at their current "Base" which will be a note from 
				Dr. Matasan.  It will be asking them the players to all leave, or else suffer horrible consequences.  This will also trigger another note - from an insider who wants to stop 
				Matasan but doesn't have the skills.  He will reveal the location of a small hut he has deep in the island.  In that hut will be the passcode as well as a massive amount of quest knowledge.  </p>
			<p>Upon finding that room, (and a skeleton inside), Matasan will leave the players a note explaining the options that they have.  They can help him achieve immortality, in exchange he will make 
				them immortal, or they can leave (fight him).  If they wish to become immortal, they will need to travel to the nether and find a few items.  Otherwise, they will simply need to prepare for a difficult battle.</p>	
			
			<h3>Dr. Zhāng (Dr. Z)</h3>
				<p>Players will be introduced to the foremost nuclear physicist Dr. Z.  Dr. Z. was working on many projects, but ultimately it was environmental, stable, and highly effective power generation.  Her first base of operations is a volcano within the island as she was conducting tests on using extreme geothermal as both a cheap source of energy but a way to reduce catastrophic 
					volcano explosions.  This base has since been abandoned, but is full of machines and gadgets.  It contains many diary entries about doing more experimental work with highly volatile substances.  Also that there is a new lab that will need to be built.</p>
				<p>Players will travel to the new lab and find that it is open in it, they will search it, find lots of research, a few story notes, and will come by a room (that is inaccessable at this time).  When they walk by, it will trigger an event of the scientist walking up to what seems to be a summoning circle.
					After a bit of a cutscene, there is an explosion and the players are "knocked out" and find themselves waking up in a shed.  They were pulled out by a scientist in the office.  The scientist was gone by the time the group wakes up.  
					The scientist leaves a note, explaining a bit of the story, and asking to please stop the summoning.  This can be done by stopping the next phase of the summon, which requires building a blade that can kill the first demon.
					</p>

		
			<h3>Side Quests in Chapter 1</h3>
				<p>Chapter 1 will include	the most side quests, because it is meant to augment the "grind". </p>
				<h4>S. Miller's Quest</h4>
				<p>In the first botany base, a note is found from an S. Miller about a forest hideaway where some more "spiritual" crops were grown.  It was "research" kept away from the lab, as it was more for recreation.  
					Rough location is given, but it's a green elevator that takes you underground.  In the little base are a few special foods, some plants, a watering can, some pictures, lights, etc.  Empty bottles. </p>
				<h4>It's bigger on the inside</h4>
				<p>A journal entry talks about how a scientist misses home and wishes they could make a phone call.  Someone spoke of a phone box that was on the island (rough co-ordinates given).  It is the tardis, which when opened teleports you to a large room - the tardis control room.  No idea what sort of loot.</p>
				<h4>Let me axe you a question</h4>
				<p>Scientist Philip J. F. was "only brought to this stupid island to be a delivery boy it seems" as he hasn't been given any responsibility and has been forced to cart items from the different locations.  Thankfully he is very lazy, and gives approximate locations for his "dumping ground" where he delivered certain goods that were just too difficult to deliver.  This is burried slightly underground and contains lots of ingots and materials, as well as some other trinkets (and possibly an artifact)</p>
				<h4>Leira's Revenge</h4>
				<p>So much work with animals, and life on an exotic island has caused Leira to want to live amongst the aquatic animals.  So, she slowly built herself a base under water and started working on research to give her waterbreathing and amazing swimming abilities.  (Loot is waterbreathing potions, and gear that helps swim)</p>
				<h4>The Baminati</h4>
				<p>Scientist Jon Bams believes that this entire operation is headed up by the fabled illuminati.  He wants to prove it. Look for the triangle in the forest, dig down 21 blocks, then east 21 blocks?

			<h2>CHAPTER 2 - Path Chosen</h2>
			<p>This part will be resolving either (or both) of the two chosen paths in Chapter 1.  Either seeking out the necessary ingredients to complete the summoning/create immortality, or to craft the weapon necessary to slay the demon (and general prep for a fight with a vampire)</p>
			<p>A great deal of this will take place in the twilight forest.  The ingredients will only be dropped by the main bosses.  Without flight, many of the bosses will be difficult and will require multiple players playing at the same time to clear easily.</p>
			<p>During this stage, either of the main NPCs will try to sway characters to join them (and abandon their other players).  Incentives will be high, usually ensuring their safety, being a knight in the new regime, etc. </p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>CHAPTER 3</h2>
			<p>This chapter will resolve both storylines.  The resolution of one may also lead to the resolution of another.  Summoning the demon with Dr. Z. could result in the Demon killing Dr. Matasan.  (I guess leaving the possibility of doing that, then slaying the huge demon, but that'd essentially be suicide, and would result in a "bad ending"?)</p>
